## Installing Git

There are a few options for using git to track a project. Behind all of them is the same command-based system that you're probably somewhat familiar with. Paired with a hosting option, a git-tracked project can extend those commands and its endless benefits to a team of any size. We'll be using GitHub to host ours.

There happens to be a desktop git solution made by GitHub and it doesn't suck, so we'll use that for now.

### [Github for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

I recommend this route for now because:

- Graphical interface.
    
- We'll be using git with Github specifically, and its a git app... from and for Gitub. (It's worth noting again the difference between git and git hosts like Github. Git is to Github as porn is to Pornhub. There are other options like Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc.)
    
- It's aimed at people new to git who want to do exactly what we're trying to do: open a project up to a small team for colloaboration.
    
- Eventually you might find yourself using git via commands in a terminal. When you do, you'll recognize a lot of the commands from using this app. While it combines and obscures them a little bit for ease-of-use, it does a good job of building familiarity nonetheless.
    
- Being a user-friendly git app designed to work with github, its the best possible intro to the three main topics:
    
    - Git (the system)
    - Repositories (the thing git works upon/with. We're making a repository for our mod.)
    - Remotes (hosted repositories)

## Getting Started

1. **Click 'Use this template'** (pictured below) to start your own repository with included tools, documentation, and file-structure to help jump-start collaboration on your mod.

2. **Finish creating your repository**. Note the image below. Feel free to make the repo public, but it isn't neccessary. It can be private and you will still be able to collaborate with others. You can always change this setting (as well as the name and description!) later on.

3. **Click "Clone or download"** in your newly generated repository, and then **"Open in Desktop"**.

4. **Click "Choose..." to select a folder** when Github for Desktop prompts you. In the image below, I chose a folder called *projects*. This is where the mod repo will be stored locally for you to work on.

5. **Copy the contents of your mod** (ex: anim, exported, scripts, modmain.lua, etc) into */mod*. Then open Github for Desktop and you will notice that these additions are listed as Changes.

7. **Type a commit message** then click **Commit to master**. Congratulations! You've made your first commit to the repository. It contained the addition of you mod files, and it established the **master branch**.

8. All thats left is to push this to Github. This last step is a moment to appreciate what git is about, and the job its being tasked with. It will strive to capture & reflect the changes you made wherever the repo may be, while tolerating time & version discrepancies across the team. When it can't, it shines even then by recognizing it and prompting a project member to settle what it couldn't confidently.
