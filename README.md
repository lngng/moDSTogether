# Getting Started

1. On this page, click 'Use this template' (pictured below) to start your own repository with the included tools, file-structure, and documentation to help jump-start collaboration on your mod.

2. Complete the process by filling in your details. Note the image above. Feel free to make the repo public, but it isn't neccessary. It can be private and you will still be able to collaborate with others. You can always change this setting later.

4.  Github for Desktop should open with the prompt shown below. The Repository URL field can be left as is. For Local Path, click "Choose..." to select a folder. (In the image below, I chose a folder called "projects". This is where the mod repo will be stored locally for you to work on.)

5.  Navigate to the folder you just chose. You will see a directory called "mod". Copy the contents of your mod (ex: anim, exported, scripts, modmain.lua, etc) into this folder. Then open Github for Desktop and you will notice that these additions are listed as Changes.
